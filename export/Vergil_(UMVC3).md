## Vergil

![](/images/Umvc3_vergil_face.jpg‎ "/images/Umvc3_vergil_face.jpg‎") The
second Son of Sparda, and Dante's older twin brother who was thought to
be dead by him but in reality was merely separated after their mother's
murder. Unlike Dante, who is cocky, hot-blooded, and carefree, Vergil is
his polar opposite - cold, aloof, and power-hungry. Blaming himself for
his mother's death, he adopted the philosophy that without power, no one
can accomplish anything, and journeyed in search of more demonic power.
In contrast to Dante, a gun-wielder, Vergil prefers his father's katana,
Yamato, as well as a variety of bladed weapons. After briefly reuniting
with Dante to defeat Arkham and clashing with Dante, he decided to stay
in Hell to gain more power, but was unceremoniously ambushed by his
father's enemy Mundus, captured, and brainwashed to become the Dark
Knight, Nelo Angelo, and would eventually be killed several years later
by Dante. Unbeknownst to all, he is succeeded by Nero, his son from an
affair with an unknown woman.

**In a nutshell** Vergil is a high-damage mixup character. Boasting some
of the longest combos in the game, as well as the most powerful Hyper in
the game, Vergil is a combo-crazy maniac when on the field. However, he
must be played carefully, as many of his normal attacks are easily
punished and his overall health is relatively low. Technical players
will have a new friend in Vergil.
