## Chris

![](Umvc3_chris_face.jpg‎ "Umvc3_chris_face.jpg‎") As a member of Special
Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) Chris Redfield was one of the
first on the scene to investigate the strange occurrences in and around
Raccoon City and continued on through the destruction of Umbrella, a
company researching and testing biological warfare. Through all of this
Chris has seen the betrayal of S.T.A.R.S. captain, Albert Wesker, and
the apparent death of his partner Jill Valentine. Chris becomes a
founding member of the Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA)
and continued the battle against Bioterrorism.

**In a nutshell** Through the use of his heavy arsenal Chris is able to
compete at long range while causing a large amount of chip damage on a
guarding opponent. In many cases Chris is left with good frame advantage
in order to respond once he throws out a projectile. His variety of
close up special attacks also work to either stun or keep the opponent
pushed back into chipping range which creates a deadly combination of
control and damage. In Ultimate with improved combo abilities and the
addition of an OTG attack Chris brings more (bio) hazard this time
around.
