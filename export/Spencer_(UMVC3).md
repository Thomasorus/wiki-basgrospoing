**In a nutshell** Spencer is one of the few "viable" characters in
UMvC3. He is a fantastic anchor with great hypers, great DHC potential,
and is a fantastic person to use lvl 3 X Factor on. He has some not too
hard to do combos and has great mobility. His assists, however, are kind
of lacking. If you want a heavy hitting anchor with great mobility and
one of the best hypers in the game, use Spencer.
