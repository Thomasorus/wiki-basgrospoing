**EN TRAVAUX**

## Arthur

![](/images/Umvc3_arthur_face.jpg‎ "/images/Umvc3_arthur_face.jpg‎") The
Knight Arthur, noble and strong, had spent many years in service of the
king. He had won the heart of the kingdom, the people, and most of all
he had won the heart of the king's daughter, Princess Prin-Prin. Terror
struck the evening they were to be wed as Loki, the lord of the Ghoul
Realm, captured the Princess and took her away to his palace. Arthur
adventured to defeat Loki and his followers and continues to keep the
realm free of Ghosts and Ghouls.

**In a nutshell** Arthur is full of projectiles that can cause a lot of
chip damage against a guarding opponent or control the space with an
advancing opponent. Even when an opponent attacks point blank Arthur has
tools such as his Shield Deflect to parry the opponents attack. If chip
and run with a slew of weapons is your cup of tea then Arthur will be a
great addition to your team.
