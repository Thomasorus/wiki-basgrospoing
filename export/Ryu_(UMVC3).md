# Ryu (UMVC3)

**EN TRAVAUX**

## Ryu

![](/images/Umvc3_ryu_face.jpg‎ "/images/Umvc3_ryu_face.jpg‎") Ryu trained
for years with his friend Ken under the Shotokan master Gouken. As the
champion of the first Street Fighter tournament, defeating the Muay Thai
king Sagat, Ryu is known as one of the most dedicated fighters. Since
his victory Ryu has traveled the globe, participating in subsequent
tournaments and continuing his quest to perfect his training.

**In a nutshell** As the quintessential Street Fighter, Ryu's game plan
is focused on the ability to produce a variety of special moves to
counter opponent's strategies, along with strong mix-up capabilities. He
now has additional projectile attacks that are useful in response to a
variety of situations as well as his traditional tactics such as the
shoryuken and the tatsumakisenpukyaku. Ryu's new Hado Kakusei mode
allows from some additional over-the-top hyper attacks which means he
can burn hyper meter pretty quickly. If a new twist on an old favorite
sounds good to you then Ryu just might be your newest team member.
