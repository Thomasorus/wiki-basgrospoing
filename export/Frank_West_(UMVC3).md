**In a nutshell** Frank West is a unique character that was built for
supporting teams. He starts out weak, but by utilizing his snapshot
ability, he can level himself up like Dead Rising and become stronger.
However, leveling up is directly related to how many hits are done in a
combo, so it's important to set up a big combo to maximize Frank's
abilities. By reaching level 4 and 5, Frank can gain new specials,
enhance his current specials, buff his hypers and vastly improve the
range and damage of his normal attacks. Additionally, Frank's Snap Shot
is an OTG and his Survival Techniques is easy to whiff, which means you
can set up a DHC from a point character into a snap shot and level up.
Frank can certainly pose a threat on point, most teams have optimized
Frank in the second or third slot.
