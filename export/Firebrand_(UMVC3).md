TBW

**In a nutshell** Firebrand uses flight mixups and projectiles to open
an opponent's defenses. While he may not deal much damage, his combos
are quite long, and his crossups, divekick, and ability to swoop through
the opponent make it so he can frequently start new combos every few
seconds. When his abilities are boosted by his speed boost hyper, he
becomes one of the fastest and hardest to hit characters in the game,
especially with X-Factor activated.
