**In a nutshell** A wide array of projectiles and traps and amazing air
mobility makes her a rather unique character. Although her strengths
point to keep away, she really shines with her fast tri-dash and big
hitboxes on her sword. Still, her damage leaves much to be desired which
can be mitigated by her round harvest resets. Using space control
assists to cover her projectile recovery is essential and will make her
a truly formidable character.
