## Jill

![](/images/Umvc3_jill_face.jpg‎ "/images/Umvc3_jill_face.jpg‎") TBW

**In a nutshell** A completely different Jill than what was seen from
Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, this Jill relies not on zombie traps but her pure,
unadulterated speed. Mastering how to properly use her Feral Crouch will
be key in your mix ups, especially since the Teleport Dashes out of the
Feral Crouch stance can pass through opponents. She also possesses a
command throw in the Position Exchange which can potentially open up a
lot of defensive opponents. And although the Mad Beast Level 3 Hyper
Combo is extremely difficult and delicate to use, those who master its
powers will have in their hands what may possibly be the fastest
character in Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, especially if combined with a
Level 3 X-Factor.
