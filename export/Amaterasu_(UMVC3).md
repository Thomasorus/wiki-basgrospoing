## Amaterasu

![](/images/Umvc3_amaterasu_face.jpg‎ "/images/Umvc3_amaterasu_face.jpg‎")
Amaterasu, the sun goddess, lost her physical form defeating the True
Orochi. 100 years later she was resurrected in the form of a wolf who
now uses her powers to restore beauty to the islands of Japan.

**In a nutshell** Amaterasu is a very unique and versatile character due
to her extensive weapons and swift defense. She is well equiped to force
the opponent into a corner through the use of her Thunder Edge and
airdash creating situations to increase preasure and extend combos, also
with the use of airdash. A new change to the game system in Ultimate
prevents blocking while airdashing which leaves her vulnerable to
counter attacks. Lastly, Ammy is shorter than many standing attacks
leaving the opponent vulnerable to retaliation.
