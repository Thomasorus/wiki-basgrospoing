<p><strong>EN TRAVAUX</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the guide there will be a lot of jargon thrown around and,
unless you know what these terms are referring to, it might be difficult
to understand some of the more complex lingo and slang used. For
example, what is Hit Stun and Block Stun? What’s a “Strike” or a “Wall
Bounce” or a “Forced Ground Bounce?” What do we mean when we use the
word “frames?” So before we begin, please take some time to look over
the glossary to familiarize yourself with some of these terms so the
rest of the guide will make more sense.</p>
<h2 id="attack-properties" tabindex="-1">Attack Properties</h2>
<h3 id="cancel-and-movement-properties" tabindex="-1">Cancel and Movement Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="/images/rpdfire.png" alt="" title="/images/rpdfire.png"> | A few characters
have Light Attacks that can actually chain into themselves. For
example, with Akuma, his Standing and Crouching Light Attacks can
combo into themselves to allow for some easy hit confirms. Not every
character has this, in fact more seem to not have this ability than
those who do.</li>
<li><img src="/images/airok.png" alt="" title="/images/airok.png"> | These are Special Moves
or Hyper Combos that can be performed on the ground and in the air.</li>
<li><img src="/images/aironly.png" alt="" title="/images/aironly.png"> | These are Special
Moves or Hyper Combos that can only be performed in the air.</li>
<li><img src="/images/jcancel.png" alt="" title="/images/jcancel.png"> | Some Normal Moves
can be canceled into a Jump. Storm’s Standing Medium Attack and
Crouching Hard Attack are two examples of this. In the air, a Jump
Cancelable Normal Move only works for those who have Double Jumps.</li>
<li><img src="/images/djcancel.png" alt="" title="/images/djcancel.png"> | Same as a Jump
Cancelable Normal Move, but for Normal Moves performed while airborne
that can be canceled into a Double Jump.</li>
<li><img src="/images/dashcancel.png" alt="" title="/images/dashcancel.png"> | A few rare
Normal Moves can be canceled into ground Dashes. In fact, they almost
all seem to be possessed by Doctor Doom. Pretty much every single one
of his ground moves can be canceled into a Ground Dash, either forward
or back.</li>
<li><img src="/images/airdashcancel.png" alt="" title="/images/airdashcancel.png"> | Only
certain Normal Moves in the air can be canceled into Air Dashes. In
general, only a few characters are actually able to cancel their air
Normal Moves into Air Dashes, Storm, Magneto, Iron Man, and Doctor
Doom being the main ones.</li>
<li><img src="/images/nocancel.png" alt="" title="/images/nocancel.png"> | This isn’t really
a property. This actually means it just lacks every single property
imaginable. But the reason it’s listed as a property is because it
also carries the distinction that it can’t even be Chained into any
other Normal Move. Wolverine’s Slide (Down/Toward + Medium Attack) is
an example of a move that has No Cancel properties.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hit-properties" tabindex="-1">Hit Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="/images/low.png" alt="" title="/images/low.png"> | These are Normal Moves or
Special Moves or even Hyper Combos that must be blocked while
crouching. You can always Air Block these moves, however.</li>
<li><img src="/images/high.png" alt="" title="/images/high.png"> | These are Normal Moves or
Special Moves or Hyper Combos that must be blocked while standing. You
can always Air Block these moves, however.</li>
<li><img src="/images/unblockable.png" alt="" title="/images/unblockable.png"> | These are
moves that cannot be blocked at all. These moves are very, very rare.
Taskmaster’s follow-ups to a blocked Sword Master, X-23’s Silent Kill,
and C. Viper’s Level 3 Focus Attack are some of the only examples in
the game.</li>
<li><img src="/images/chipdamage.png" alt="" title="/images/chipdamage.png"> | Interestingly
enough, some Normal Moves actually do Chip Damage even though they are
Normal Moves. Doctor Doom’s Hidden Missiles, Sentinel’s Standing and
Crouching Hard Attacks, and Wesker’s Toward + Hard Attack are just a
few examples.</li>
<li><img src="/images/throw.png" alt="" title="/images/throw.png"> | Ground Throws cannot be
blocked. Ground Throws only connect on grounded opponents who are not
in Hit Stun or Block Stun. All instances of being Dizzied or Staggered
or Crumpled count as being in Hit Stun, so Throws will not connect on
opponents in those states.</li>
<li><img src="/images/airthrow.png" alt="" title="/images/airthrow.png"> | Air Throws only
connect on opponents in the air and also cannot be blocked. They
cannot connect on opponents in Hit Stun or Block Stun. Character who
are falling from a Knock-Down attack are considered to be in a Hit
Reel state, so Air Throws cannot juggle opponents.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hit-effects" tabindex="-1">Hit Effects</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="/images/launch.png" alt="" title="/images/launch.png"> | Launchers are moves
that can be canceled into Super Jumps. Launchers, as mentioned before,
cause special properties that allow for Air Combo Finishers and Aerial
Exchanges. All characters obviously have Launchers when pressing the
Special Button while on the ground, but there are a few other
Launchers in the game, such as Doctor Doom’s Doom Kick (Toward + Hard
Attack on the ground), Haggar’s Hoodlum Launcher, and Chun Li’s
Hoyokusen.</li>
<li><img src="/images/aircombofinisher.png" alt="" title="/images/aircombofinisher.png"> |
Air Combo Finishers are moves that will cause The Flying Screen when
used during an Air Combo performed after a Launcher. All characters
have Air Combo Finishers when pressing the Special Button in the air
after a Launcher, but there are a few other Launchers in the game,
such as X-23’s Light Attack Talon Attack.</li>
<li><img src="/images/strk.png" alt="" title="/images/strk.png"> | Strikes are moves that,
when connecting against an opponent that is standing / crouching on
the ground, will pop them into the air but does not cause any fixed
reaction, such as a Soft Knockdown or a Wall Bounce.</li>
<li><img src="/images/otg.png" alt="" title="/images/otg.png"> | Off-The-Ground: These are
Normal Moves or Special Moves or Hyper Combos that can hit the
opponent in a Floored State. These moves are few and far between, but
very useful for extending combos after Hard Knock-Downs.</li>
<li><img src="/images/hardknockdown.png" alt="" title="/images/hardknockdown.png"> | Attacks
that cause a Hard Knock-Down will put the enemy into a Floored State
where they can be struck only by moves with OTG property. Hard
Knock-Downs ignore Hit Stun Deterioration and, before the opponent
hits the floor, they can actually be juggled. When they touch the
floor, however, only OTG moves can hit the enemy before they can roll
in either direction.</li>
<li><img src="/images/softknockdown.png" alt="" title="/images/softknockdown.png"> | Attacks
that cause a Soft Knock-Down will put the enemy into a Floored State,
but the opponent can immediately roll upon touching the ground.
Therefore, there is no period of time where the character can be hit
by an OTG move. Soft Knock-Downs ignore Hit Stun Deterioration and,
before the opponent hits the floor, they can actually be juggled. When
they touch the floor, however, the enemy will instantly roll and be
safe from further hits.</li>
<li><img src="/images/forcedtechroll.png" alt="" title="/images/forcedtechroll.png"> |
Attacks that cause a Forced Tech Roll behave exactly like a Soft
Knock-Down move, except that when the enemy hits the floor, they will
instantly perform a very short backwards roll as if getting up without
rolling and have no option to perform an actual roll.</li>
<li><img src="/images/groundbounce.png" alt="" title="/images/groundbounce.png"> | Certain
Normal Moves or Special Moves will cause a Ground Bounce on the
opponent when they hit. Ground Bounces can only occur once per combo,
however, so a second move with Ground Bounce property connecting in a
combo will just cause a Soft Knock-Down instead.</li>
<li><img src="/images/forcedgroundbounce.png" alt="" title="/images/forcedgroundbounce.png">
| Some moves that cause a Ground Bounce actually reset the Ground
Bounce state when the move connects. Essentially what this means is
that the a move with Forced Ground Bounce property will cause a Ground
Bounce regardless if there was a Ground Bounce earlier in the combo.</li>
<li><img src="/images/wallbounce.png" alt="" title="/images/wallbounce.png"> | Certain Normal
Moves or Special Moves will cause a Wall Bounce on the opponent when
they hit. Wall Bounces can only occur once per combo, however, so a
second move with Wall Bounce property connecting in a combo will just
cause a Soft Knock-Down instead. The opponent won’t even touch the
wall at all.</li>
<li><img src="/images/crumple.png" alt="" title="/images/crumple.png"> | Some moves, when
they connect, cause the opponent to slowly crumple to the floor. When
this occurs, they are freely comboable up until they hit the ground,
but they are considered airborne. Thus the first hit that connects on
them will pop them into the air. When they finish the crumple and hit
the ground, they are considered in Floored State for about half a
second before they can escape with a Roll. But even when it looks like
they are fully Floored, you can actually hit them with any move that
reaches them and it’ll pop them off the ground. It’s only for that
very brief half of a second that you need to hit them with an OTG.</li>
<li><img src="/images/stagger.png" alt="" title="/images/stagger.png"> | This is a property
where the opponent staggers backwards and are vulnerable to attacks,
but they don’t stagger for very long, especially compared to Crumples
which last very long. But any hit on the opponent keeps them grounded,
unlike Crumples, so you can perform whichever ground combo on the
opponent you want.</li>
<li><img src="/images/dzzy.png" alt="" title="/images/dzzy.png"> | These are attacks that
will cause the opponent to become dizzy. Unlike Dizzies in other
Fighting Games, you cannot shake out of these dizzies. Hsien-Ko
sometimes throws item with her Anki Hon that have Dizzy Property.
She-Hulk’s Heaven Strike is another move with Dizzy Property. Also,
Haggar’s Headbutt (Up + Hard Attack in the air), will cause dizzy only
on Counterhit, which may be the only move that has a different
behavior on Counter Hit in the game.</li>
<li><img src="/images/cptr.png" alt="" title="/images/cptr.png"> | Some moves will cause
abnormal “hit stuns” that leave the opponent in a captured state. This
can either be something such as Hawkeye’s ice arrows, which freezes
the opponent for a spell, or Rocket Raccoon’s net trap, which hangs
the opponent into the sky for a while, or Spiderman’s Web Ball, which
captures the opponent in a blanket of webbing. Note that moves with
the <img src="/images/cptr.png" alt="" title="/images/cptr.png"> property IGNORE ARMOR on
<img src="/images/armored.png" alt="" title="/images/armored.png"> moves!</li>
<li><img src="/images/armored.png" alt="" title="/images/armored.png"> | Some moves are
Armored and can absorb one hit without stopping. Hulk’s Standing Heavy
and Sentinel’s Launcher, for example, can pass through one hit from
the opponent. However, if you can manage to hit those moves twice
before they hit you, you can break through the armor.</li>
<li><img src="/images/counter.png" alt="" title="/images/counter.png"> | These are moves that
will trigger attacks only when struck by the opponent. A lot of
Counters counter only moves of a specific height, such as the Light
and Medium versions of Amaterasu’s Solar Flare (Light counters high
and mid attacks, Medium counters mid and low attacks). Some Counters
will counter any height, such as Taskmaster’s Aegis Counter.</li>
<li><img src="/images/projcounter.png" alt="" title="/images/projcounter.png"> | These are
moves that will trigger attacks only when struck by the opponent’s
Projectiles.</li>
<li><img src="/images/proj.png" alt="" title="/images/proj.png"> | Many, many moves in UMvC3
are qualified as a “Projectile”. This is very important, as
Projectiles have a very complex system by which they interact with
each other, and there are many moves in the game that can counter
Projectiles or nullify Projectiles. Knowing what moves count as a
Projectile can make a huge difference in a match.</li>
<li><img src="/images/projectilereflect.png" alt="" title="/images/projectilereflect.png"> |
There are some moves that are Projectile Reflectors. Whenever a
Projectile strikes these moves, they are bounced back at the opponent.
These moves, however, do not work on beams.</li>
<li><img src="/images/projnull.png" alt="" title="/images/projnull.png"> | Though very rare,
there are some moves that are tagged with a Projectile Nullifying
property. Sentinel has a bunch of Normal Moves, for example, that can
just nullify Projectiles if he punches them.</li>

<h2 id="base-magic-series" tabindex="-1">Base Magic Series</h2>
<p>Every character has a rule set they must abide to that dictates what
Normal Moves can be chained into which other Normal Moves: the Magic
Series. However, most characters have a ruleset unique to themselves,
especially given the fact that many of the Unique Attacks have their own
idiosyncrasies on how they can be used in Chain Combos. But for the most
part, almost every character has a sequence derived from one of four
“base” Magic Series.</p>
<h3 id="zig-zag-magic-series" tabindex="-1">Zig-Zag Magic Series</h3>
<p>In the Zig-Zag Magic Series, you have the ability to chain all 6
different forms of attacks (L, M, and H while standing and L, M, and H
while crouching) into each other. The order which you can perform your
moves is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Standing <img src="/images/Lumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Lumvc3.png"></li>
<li>Crouching <img src="/images/Lumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Lumvc3.png"></li>
<li>Standing <img src="/images/Mumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Mumvc3.png"></li>
<li>Crouching <img src="/images/Mumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Mumvc3.png"></li>
<li>Standing <img src="/images/Humvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Humvc3.png"></li>
<li>Crouching <img src="/images/Humvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Humvc3.png"></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="stronger-magic-series" tabindex="-1">Stronger Magic Series</h3>
<p>In the Stronger Magic Series, you can typically only chain into a
stronger attack. The order which you can perform you moves is as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Standing or Crouching <img src="/images/Lumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Lumvc3.png"></li>
<li>Standing or Crouching <img src="/images/Mumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Mumvc3.png"></li>
<li>Standing or Crouching <img src="/images/Humvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Humvc3.png"></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="stronger%2B-magic-series" tabindex="-1">Stronger+ Magic Series</h3>
<p>The Stronger+ Magic Series is exactly like Stronger. The real only
difference is that you are allowed to chain two Light Attacks, so long
as one is standing and the other is crouching, into each other before
needing to move to a stronger button. The order which you can perform
you moves is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Standing or Crouching <img src="/images/Lumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Lumvc3.png"></li>
<li>Standing or Crouching <img src="/images/Lumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Lumvc3.png">
(in the opposite state from previous attack)</li>
<li>Standing or Crouching <img src="/images/Mumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Mumvc3.png"></li>
<li>Standing or Crouching <img src="/images/Humvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Humvc3.png"></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="light-start-magic-series" tabindex="-1">Light Start Magic Series</h3>
<p>For the Light Start Magic Series, Medium and Heavy Attack buttons all
fall into one group, and you can only start the Chain from a Light
Attack and chain into any of the four stronger buttons (standing or
crouching m and standing or crouching h). But that’s the end of it from
there. The order, thusly, is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Standing or Crouching <img src="/images/Lumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Lumvc3.png"></li>
<li>Standing or Crouching <img src="/images/Mumvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Mumvc3.png">
or Standing or Crouching
<img src="/images/Humvc3.png" alt="" title="/images/Humvc3.png"></li>
</ol>
<p>If a Magic Series is more than two buttons long, you can skip any of the
middle buttons and jump straight to later buttons in the series.
However, you can never go backwards in a series. For example, Wolverine
has the Zig-Zag Magic Series listed above. But he does have to go in
that specific order. He can choose to just do a Standing Light Attack
-&gt; Standing Medium Attack -&gt; Crouching Medium Attack -&gt; Crouching
Hard Attack, skipping the Crouching Light Attack and Standing Hard
Attack all together. However, he cannot do a Standing Light Attack -&gt;
Standing Hard Attack and then back to a Crouching Medium Attack. You can
only progress forward in the series.</p>
<p>In the case of Stronger+, things get really confusing once you start
throwing in Rapid Fire Light Attacks. For example, Akuma has a Stronger+
Magic Series, but he also has a Rapid Fire Standing L as well as a Rapid
Fire Crouching L, meaning those attacks can chain into themselves. The
best way to understand it is that every time you chain a Light Attack
into itself, it “resets” the state of the Magic Series. However, if you
chain into the opposite Light Attack, it counts are part of the Magic
Series. Thus, you cannot actually perform a Chain like so: Crouching L
into Standing L into Crouching L. Once you chain into the opposite
state, it counts as part of the Chain. However, if you switch states and
then Rapid Fire an L attack into itself, it RESETS the Magic Series, so
now it’s as if you are starting from scratch and you can chain back to
the opposite state again. So you CAN do: Crouch L into Standing L into
Standing L into Crouching L. The Crouch L into Stand L counts as the
Magic Series, but Chaining from Standing L into Standing L is a Rapid
Fire L chain, so it resets the Magic Series so you can now, using Magic
Series, chaing from Standing L into Crouching L again. But to be honest,
all of this, while confusing, will almost NEVER come up in a real
battle, as chaining multiple L’s into themselves is a really bad idea
thanks to Hit Stun Deterioration, so not understanding this whole
paragraph really won’t affect you at all in the long run.</p>
<p>Once again, though everyone’s Magic Series follow those three patterns
closely, everyone has exceptions to the rule that will deviate from the
expected pattern.</p>
<h2 id="commonly-used-jargon" tabindex="-1">Commonly Used Jargon</h2>
<h3 id="hit-stun-and-block-stun" tabindex="-1">Hit Stun and Block Stun</h3>
<p>Two terms will be used a lot in this guide: Hit Stun and Block Stun. If
you notice, whenever you land an attack on the opponent, the opponent
gets “stuck” in a state. When you hit them, they go into an animation of
reeling from getting hit. When they block your attack, they get stuck in
a blocking pose for a fixed amount of time.</p>
<p>These are what are referred to as Hit Stun and Block Stun. Hit Stun is
the concept that, when hit, you are stuck in the reel animation for a
while. Any hits that connect during your Hit Stun are considered a hit
that combos on you. And Block Stun is the concept that, when you block
an attack, you are stuck in the block pose for a while. Any attack that
connects on you during Block Stun is considered a true Block String.
These are very important concepts to know about, and they will be talked
about a lot throughout this guide.</p>
<h3 id="frames" tabindex="-1">Frames</h3>
<p>The word “Frame” is going to be used a lot in this guide. We’re going to
be talking about Active Frames, Frame Advantage, animation frames, etc.
etc. So without understanding what a frame is, you’re going to get very
lost very quickly. The easiest way to understand frames is to think
about everything that happens on the screen as a cartoon. In a cartoon,
you have to draw one picture at a time so that, when played in rapid
succession, each picture creates an animation. Each of these pictures
can be called an animation frame.</p>
<p>That’s what happens on the screen in Marvel Vs. Capcom 3. Every movement
a character makes, every attack they perform goes through a set of what
you can call an animation frame. So some moves are made up of 20
animation frames. Some moves are made up of as many as 200 frames. This
is all we are referring to when we talk about frames. And keep in mind
that Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 is a game that outputs 60 frames per second. So
if we say something like “there is a 6 frame window you can perform this
action,” that means you have 1/10th of a second to perform the action.</p>
<p>Frame Data is included in each characters move list. Currently frame
data is set up as so, Start up/active/recovery and is followed by
advantage on hit/advantage on block. So for instance 6/9/13 means it has
a start up of 6 frames, the move is active for 9 frames and has a
recovery period for 13 frames. Additionally if you see +9/-5 it means
you have 9 frames to link the next move on hit and on block you can be
punished within 5 frames.</p>
<h3 id="damage-scaling" tabindex="-1">Damage Scaling</h3>
<p>“Damage Scaling” is an effect hits within the same combo have where each
successive hit deals less damage than they normally would, eventually
leading to the character-specific “Damage Scaling Minimum”. Click the
following link for the full page of details regarding Damage Scaling and
Damage Scaling Minimum Values.</p>

<h3 id="extra-terminology" tabindex="-1">Extra Terminology</h3>
<p>Here are a bunch of terms used commonly to describe different aspects of
Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3. In fact, many of these terms are universal
among all Fighting Games. Read on to see what they mean.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bn’B - Bn’B stands for “Bread n’ Butter.” The term basically is a
euphemism for something “standard” and very common. So when used in
the context of Fighting Games, it refers to the very basics. The most
common area it is used with is in reference to Combos. When someone
refers to something as a “Bn’B Combo,” it refers to the basic,
standard, most common and effective Combo that is typically used for a
character. However, don’t think of it as the most simple combo
possible – Dante’s Bn’B, for example, involves Bold Cancels and all
sorts of Combo trickery – again, it refers to the most useful and
practical combo for the character.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Buff / Nerf - You’re gonna hear a lot of things referred to as a
“buff” or a “nerf” in UMvC3, mainly because of the vast amount of
changes to the varying characters. A “buff” is simply that: a change
that has improved the character in any way possible. A “nerf” is the
exact opposite: a change that has reduced the quality of the character
in any way. The term “nerf” comes exactly from where you’d think: the
Nerf toy lines. Basically, a “Nerf” item usually is padded, soft, and
has none of the deadly abilities of its real life counter part (like
Nerf guns). Thus, when a move is made less deadly, it’s been “nerfed.”</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Lag - This is in relation to on-line game play, due to the transfer of
data between long distances over a network the game can slowdown or
even pause at times. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has a lag simulator
in training mode that can be activated to allow practicing in
situations where the game may slow down.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Mix-up - Mix-ups can be referred to as pressure applied to your
opponent that your opponent has great difficulty defending against.
Mix-ups typically involve getting the opponent to block the wrong way
(in terms of a high / low attack or a left / right attack).</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Reset - Resets typically refer to the act of purposefully ending a
Combo early simply to land a Mix-up that gets the opponent into a new
combo. The advantage of this is that many opponents may not be
expecting a reset, and thus get caught with a new Combo. Of course,
the new Combo also has its damage and Hit Stun Deterioration reset as
well, so you can get a lot more damage off of a reset than just
finishing a Combo fully.</li>
</ul>
