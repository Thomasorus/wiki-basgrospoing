<p><img src="/images/Umvc3_wesker_face.jpg" alt="" title="/images/Umvc3_wesker_face.jpg">
Albert Wesker was one of the Umbrella Corporation’s top scientists and
executives, who had been stationed through connections as the leader of
the S.T.A.R.S Alpha Team to save face in public. When his “team” was
called to infiltrate a lone mansion, which just so happened to be an
Umbrella testing ground, he betrayed his “comrades” and used the
incident to test his genetic experiments. When the mansion ended up
destroyed, he was presumed dead, but Wesker survived thanks to an
experimental virus he injected into himself created by his ally William
Birkin prior to being knocked unconscious by a Tyrant. The virus did not
zombify him like so many others, instead giving him enhanced reflexes,
speed, and strength, as well as the ability to regenerate. He began
working in the shadows after Umbrella’s downfall, and eventually secured
himself a position within the TriCell corporation, using it as a front
to complete his greatest and most diabolical achievement of all - the
Uroboros Virus. His ultimate goal was to release his virus into the
Earth’s atmosphere, killing millions and selecting only a few “chosen”
humans based on DNA to serve him as he ruled the world as a god, but his
plans were foiled in one final confrontation with longtime enemy Chris
Redfield, who finally killed him for good.</p>
<p><strong>In a nutshell</strong> Wesker is back, and this time around he’s out to prove
that his claims of godhood are real. His Samurai Edge is as irritating
as ever (and is still the best OTG assist in the game), his mobility and
speed make his rushdown, mixups, and pressure game a menace, and his
teleport shenanigans have been strengthened with the addition of Cobra
Strike to his repertoire of teleport cancels. The most jarring, and
easily the best change to Wesker, is that when his sunglasses are
removed via damage or Phantom Dance, he gains a power boost equivalent
to a Level 1 X-Factor. While he suffers from zoning tactics, if you want
a character that allows you to make the most of your fundamentals,
Wesker is for you.</p>
